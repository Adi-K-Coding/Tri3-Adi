## 5.1 Tech Talk Notes and Actions
### Notes: 
Technology can be used in so many different ways, and there are endless different possiblitied with technology. When you hold a phone or computer in your hands, you have the whole of the world at your disposal. Technology has so many benefits for society, but it can be used in potentially harmful ways. That is why it is important to set regulations and have rules that prevent technology from being used in the wrong ways or falling into the wrong hands. 


### Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
Three beneficials effects of computing are that they allow real time collaboration and communication between people. They also allow more efficient work to be done, and allow information to be widespread and can be accessed from anywhere around the world. Computer also allows for saving space(storage) and allows tasks to be automated. 

However, on the flip side, there are also cons. These include a potential for the loss of privacy/data, since your data can be hacked into and stolen. Computers also cause all types of health problems, whether it be mental or phyical health issues. Computers can also cause a lot of wasted time as there are too many potential links you could click and lose track of time on. 
### Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Dopamine issues are real and not a parent conspiracy. Dopammine is the hormone the body releases when it is happy. We get dopamine hits anytime we do something enjoyable. One of the biggest issues in todays day and age are that social media have created it so that everytime we scroll and see a new post, or a new comment, like a video, or share a video, we get little dopamine hits. This has created a culture where we are used to getting fast dopamine hits. This affects attention spans as once something doesn't give you a quick dopamine hit, you get bored and try to find something else. Furthermore, people are more likely to give up on things as they aren't looking long term, and get discouraged when they don't get the quick dopamine hits. I can relate to this as I can admit I spend too much time on social media scrolling endlessly. I think that sometimes I need to take a step back and stop scrolling. I also thinnk I need to work on looking at things long term so that I don't get discouraged so easily when things dont' work out right away.

### Notes:
Digital divide is the difference in access to technology between different people or groups of people. This can be due to access to internet, or different belief systems that prevent them from using technology. Whatever the case, there is a divide between people. Different factors that can contribute to the divide are socioeconomic factors, geographic factors, demographic factors, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. 
The digital divide can be reduced by giving people access to technology. For example, at Del Norte, every student was given chromebooks, to make sure that they had access to a device that allows them to access the internet. 
### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
To empower themselves in a digital world, one can turn online. People can find thousands and thousands of pages of people like them, and find things in common with them. One can participate in the digital world, and use the knowlege they gain online to improve and utilize real life skills and interactions. 
### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Somebody that is empowered could help somebody that is not empowered by including them in various forms of digital communication and utilization. They could teach them how to use certain feature online, which would help them become more empowered, or show them certain features, and expose them to the thousands of different websites, features, and technologies available on the internet. At Del Norte HS, I could help by creating videos that showcase different features of websites such as google drive, as some people don't know how to use this website, or don't know helpful tips and tricks. 
### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
When it comes to technology, there are many digital barries and red tape blocking people from reach certain websites. Howver, these are for the most part beneficial because they stop people from going to sites that could be potentially harmful for them or their computer. A Del Norte, certain site are blocked, such as innapropriate sites, or sites for gaming, which are distracting during school. 

## 5.3 Tech Talk Notes
### Notes:
Computer can sometimes have bias in their algorithms. The bias is most often unintentional, but it can have drastic effects and can cause problems for the developers. Bias can also be intentional ways, such as in advertising when advertising certain products. 
### Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
While the owner of the computer and the video creator was in a joking mood, it could potentially be a serious problem as the computer did not track somebody with a darker skin color. This bias was most likely not intentional as the programmers/developers of the technology did not intend for this to happen. After looking into the comments for possible explanations, I found that a possible explanation for this effect could be that the computer looks at certain pigments for movements, and the combination of the background and skin color made it difficult for the computer to track the man with the darker skin color. This problem should be corrected, and the bias removed so that other people with similar skin color aren't affected. 

## 5.4 Tech Talk Notes
### Notes:
Crowdsourcing can be potenially beneficial because it allows many people to collaborate and work together on projects. Multiple people are able to contribute their ideas, and thus the project can be more accurate, and can be completed faster. However, on the flip side, it can be negative, or untrustworty, such as wikipedia, because anybody can add anything they want, and we don't know if it is correct or not.

### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
A crowdsource idea that we could implement in CSP is large database of information on all types of topics. Now not every person or even every scrum team knows everything, so by crowdsourcing to all the students, everybody can add information on things that they know about, and the database would include more topics, and be more accurate, due to the implementation of crowdsourcing. 

### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

Our final project could be better with crowdsourcing. This is because we have an idea to add a database with tennis events in it. Instead of us having to individually add every event, we can add a feature where other people can just add their own events in with the results, and this would make data entry more efficient and convenient.
